Joey's Airline Project Reflection

What I Did
In this project I completed the Passengers, Sales, and Read/Write classes along with the GUI(mainwindow.xaml).  I also wrote the loops that are featured in our 

ViewModel class that generates a list of passengers to the manifest based on how many passengers purchased tickets for a given flight. 

What I Enjoyed
I enjoyed the freedom to interprate how to construct this airline interface. For our project, Kao and I built this project from the perspective of an airline who 

wanted to view information on the various flights our airline has.  Another interpretation of this project was to go through the process of purchasing a ticket 

and choosing a seat.  It helped having similar visions when we first sat down to talk about how we would go about completing this project.

What I Found Difficult
Implementing mvvm was a struggle at first and we spent the most time figuring that out than any other aspect of the problem.  We saw lots of different ways to 

implement it online but not any that fit well with what we had already completed.  Had we not spent as much time solving this problem we would have had 

much more time to add features to the project.

What Worked
I liked how our UI turned out along with how our project works and what information is made available to the user and how it gets there. I also like how our 

manifest is formatted in the text file because that it looks cleaner and it was interesting to learn how you have some control over the format of what is written 

to a text file.  Kao and I also had a cohesive vision of the project which helped with splitting up the work and getting through the project relatively stress-free.  

We went through the requirement of the project and briefly talked about how we would satisfy them.  I believe this structure helped us complete the project 

with few bumps in the road. 

What I Would Do Differently
If we went back and had a chance to do the project again knowing what we do now, I would make the project a little more complex.  We could add in features 

from a customer's POV such as the ability to purchase a ticket and select a seat.  Other features we could have added to what we did accomplish would be 

adding a seat number to the manifest for each passenger and adding more functionality to the UI such as a refresh button or a login page.
